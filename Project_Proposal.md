# Churn for bank customers


> ## Introduction
> 
>> The purpose of the model I plan to build is to predict whether an individual customer will churn from the bank (or not) given various data points and information from a historical database.
>>
>>So in the future, when we have a customer, we can predict if this person will leave or not. This will help with the decision making framework for whether a customer will leave or not.
>>
>>With this prediction model, the bank will benefit from being able to predict the risk of the customer on whether they will leave or not.

> ## Goals
> 
>> To predict if the customer will churn from the bank or not.



> ## Data Description
> 
>> I will take the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mathchi/churn-for-bank-customers), I plan to use these **classes & features**:
>
 | class  |  Description |
 | ------------- | ------------- |
 | exited  | customer will leave |
 | not exited | customer will stay |

 >
